        ðŸ“£ IMPORTANT NOTICE - PR LOCK DOWN ðŸ”’    04/2022
        We are excited to announce that fabric is migrating to modern typescript/javascript ðŸ¤©.
        This means we will â›” not be accepting any PRs out of scope with the migration.
        We understand this might be annoying but wasted work is ever more so.
        The migration will be extreme on the source code so PRs from before will probably become stale to the point of death after the migration.
        It hurts us the throw away good work, effort and time put into fabric so please stay patient.
        You are welcome to join the migration effort ðŸ”¨
        https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/issues/7596

        If you remain strong minded about PRing and the fix is small you can submit a PR to the 5.x branch
        During the migration we will port these changes to master
