# Data updaters

A collection of updaters for breaking changes upgrades.
Meant to be a support during transition of existing projects and NOT as a way to keep deprecated data working.

Please update your data once you upgrade

Those updaters are tested through examples and unit tests,
DO NOT RUN THEM ON YOUR PRODUCTION DATA WITHOUT TRIPLE CHECKING EVERYTHING, THANKS.
