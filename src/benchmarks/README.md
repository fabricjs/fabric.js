# Benchmarks

This folder contains files with code we used to evaluate code changes and as a quick repository to test our changes again if necessary.

This folder is in JS and import code from the build of Fabric so we can test an implementation that is more similar to the end result.

NOTE: as of now the files for now are not supposed to run with a command, this folder is just a warehouse of test functions, possibly runnable witn `node filepath.mjs``
