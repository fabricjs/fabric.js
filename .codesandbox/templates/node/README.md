# Fabric Node Sandbox

A node app for reproducing `fabric` server side issues and creating examples.

## Reproducing

Creating a clear, easy to use reproduction is very **IMPORTANT**.
Keep it simple and concise.
Don't add stuff that is out of scope.

Make sure you are reproducing with the correct version of fabric.

Provide a **detailed description** including steps to reproduce in the [`REPRODUCE.md`](./REPRODUCE.md) file.

Navigate to [`src/index`](./src/index.mjs) and start editing.
